<h1 id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h1>
<p>a. This security incident response policy is intended to establish controls to ensure detection of security
    vulnerabilities and incidents, as well as quick reaction and response to security breaches.</p>
<p>a. This document also provides implementing instructions for security incident response, to include definitions,
    procedures, responsibilities, and performance measures (metrics and reporting mechanisms).</p>
<p>a. This policy applies to all users of information systems within the organization. This typically includes employees
    and contractors, as well as any external parties that come into contact with systems and information controlled by
    the organization (hereinafter referred to as “users”). This policy must be made readily available to all users.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>a. A key objective of the organization’s Information Security Program is to focus on detecting information security
    weaknesses and vulnerabilities so that incidents and breaches can be prevented wherever possible. The organization
    is committed to protecting its employees, customers, and partners from illegal or damaging actions taken by others,
    either knowingly or unknowingly. Despite this, incidents and data breaches are likely to happen; when they do, the
    organization is committed to rapidly responding to them, which may include identifying, containing, investigating,
    resolving , and communicating information related to the breach.</p>
<p>a. This policy requires that all users report any perceived or actual information security vulnerability or incident
    as soon as possible using the contact mechanisms prescribed in this document. In addition, the organization must
    employ automated scanning and reporting mechanisms that can be used to identify possible information security
    vulnerabilities and incidents. If a vulnerability is identified, it must be resolved within a set period of time
    based on its severity. If an incident is identified, it must be investigated within a set period of time based on
    its severity. If an incident is confirmed as a breach, a set procedure must be followed to contain, investigate,
    resolve, and communicate information to employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders. </p>
<p>c. Within this document, the following definitions apply:</p>
<pre><code>i. *Information Security Vulnerability:* <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> vulnerability <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">an</span> information <span class="hljs-keyword">system</span>, information <span class="hljs-keyword">system</span> security procedures, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> administrative controls that could be exploited <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> gain unauthorized access <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> information <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> disrupt critical processing.
    
    i. *Information Security Incident:* <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> suspected, attempted, successful, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> imminent threat <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> unauthorized access, use, disclosure, breach, modification, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> destruction <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> information; interference <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> information technology operations; <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> significant violation <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> information security policy.
    </code></pre>
<h1 id="policy">Policy</h1>
<p>a. All users must report any system vulnerability , incident, or event pointing to a possible incident to the
    Information Security Manager (ISM) as quickly as possible but no later than 24 hours. Incidents must be reported by
    sending an email message to <insert email address here> with details of the incident.</p>
<p>a. Users must be trained on the procedures for reporting information security incidents or discovered
    vulnerabilities, and their responsibilities to report such incidents. Failure to report information security
    incidents shall be considered to be a security violation and will be reported to the Human Resources (HR) Manager
    for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>a. Information and artifacts associated with security incidents (including but not limited to files, logs, and screen
    captures) must be preserved in the event that they need to be used as evidence of a crime.</p>
<p>a. All information security incidents must be responded to through the incident management procedures defined below.
</p>
<p>a. In order to appropriately plan and prepare for incidents, the organization must review incident response
    procedures at least once per year for currency, and update as required.</p>
<p>a. The incident response procedure must be tested on at least twice per year</p>
<p>a. The incident response logs must be reviewed once per month to assess response effectiveness.</p>
<h1 id="procedure-for-establishing-incident-response-system">Procedure For Establishing Incident Response System</h1>
<p>a. Define on-call schedule and assign an Information Security Manager (ISM) responsible for managing incident
    response procedure during each availability window.</p>
<p>a. Define notification channel to alert the on-call ISM of a potential security incident. Establish company resource
    that includes up to date contact information for on-call ISM.</p>

    assessment to review and confirm the details of the incident. If the incident is confirmed, the ISM must assess the
    impact to the organization and assign a severity level, which will determine the level of remediation effort
    required:</p>
<pre><code>i. High: <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> incident is potentially catastrophic <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> organization <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span>/<span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> disrupts <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> organization’s day-<span class="hljs-built_in">to</span>-day operations; <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> violation <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> legal, regulatory <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> contractual requirements is likely.

Low: <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> incident is <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">clear</span> violation <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> organizational security policy, but will <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> substantively impact <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> business.
    </code></pre>
<p>a. The ISM, in consultation with management sponsors, shall determine appropriate incident response activities in
    order to contain and resolve incidents.</p>
<p>a. The ISM must take all necessary steps to preserve forensic evidence (e.g. log information, files, images) for
    further investigation to determine if any malicious activity has taken place. All such information must be preserved
    and provided to law enforcement if the incident is determined to be malicious.</p>
<p>a. If the incident is deemed as High or Medium, the ISM must work with the VP Brand/Creative, General Counsel, and HR
    Manager to create and execute a communications plan that communicates the incident to users, the public, and others
    affected.</p>
<p>a. The ISM must take all necessary steps to resolve the incident and recover information systems, data, and
    connectivity. All technical steps taken during an incident must be documented in the organization’s incident log,
    and must contain the following:</p>
