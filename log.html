<h1 id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h1>
<p>a. This log management and review policy defines specific requirements for information systems to generate, store,
    process, and aggregate appropriate audit logs across the organization’s entire environment in order to provide key
    information and detect indicators of potential compromise.</p>
<p>a. This policy applies to all information systems within the organization’s production network.</p>
<p>a. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and partners of the organization that administer or provide
    maintenance on the organization’s production systems. Throughout this policy, these individuals are referred to as
    system administrators.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>a. In order to measure an information system’s level of security through confidentiality, integrity, and
    availability, the system must collect audit data that provides key insights into system performance and activities.
    This audit data is collected in the form of system logs. Logging from critical systems, applications, and services
    provides information that can serve as a starting point for metrics and incident investigations. This policy
    provides specific requirements and instructions for how to manage such logs.</p>
<h1 id="policy">Policy</h1>
<p>a. All production systems within the organization shall record and retain audit-logging information that includes the
    following information:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span>. Activities performed on the system.
    
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span>. The user or entity (<span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.e</span>. system account) that performed the activity, including the system that the activity was performed from.
    
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span>. The file, application, or other <span class="hljs-selector-tag">object</span> that the activity was performed on.
    
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span>. The <span class="hljs-selector-tag">time</span> that the activity occurred.
    
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span>. The tool that the activity was performed with.
    
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span>. The outcome (e<span class="hljs-selector-class">.g</span>., success or failure) of the activity.
    </code></pre>
<p>a. Specific activities to be logged must include, at a minimum:</p>
<pre><code>i. Information (including authentication information such <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> usernames <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> passwords) is created, <span class="hljs-built_in">read</span>, updated, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> deleted. 
    
    i. Accepted <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> initiated network connections. 
    
    i. User authentication <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> authorization <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> systems <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> networks.
    
    i. Granting, modification, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> revocation <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> access rights, including adding <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> user <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> group; changing user privileges, <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span> permissions, database object permissions, firewall rules, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> passwords.
    
    i. System, network, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> services configuration changes, including software installation, patches, updates, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> other installed software changes.
    
    i. Startup, shutdown, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> restart <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">an</span> application. 
    
    i. Application <span class="hljs-built_in">process</span> abort, failure, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> abnormal <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>, especially due <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> resource exhaustion <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> reaching <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> resource limit <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> threshold (such <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> CPU, memory, network connections, network bandwidth, disk <span class="hljs-literal">space</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> other resources), <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> failure <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> network services such <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> DHCP <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> DNS, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> hardware fault.
    
    i. Detection <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> suspicious <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span>/<span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> malicious activity <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> security <span class="hljs-keyword">system</span> such <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">an</span> Intrusion Detection <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> Prevention System (IDS/IPS), anti-virus <span class="hljs-keyword">system</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> anti-spyware <span class="hljs-keyword">system</span>.
    </code></pre>
<p>a. Unless technically impractical or infeasible, all logs must be aggregated in a central system so that activities
    across different systems can be correlated, analyzed, and tracked for similarities, trends, and cascading effects.
    Log aggregation systems must have automatic and timely log ingest, event and anomaly tagging and alerting, and
    ability for manual review.</p>
<p>a. Logs must be manually reviewed on a regular basis:</p>
<pre><code>i. The activities <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> users, administrators <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> system operators must be reviewed <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> least a monthly basis.
    
    ii. Logs related <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> PII must be reviewed <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> least a monthly basis <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> order <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> identify unusual behavior.
    </code></pre>
<p>a. When using an outsourced cloud environment, logs must be kept on cloud environment access and use, resource
    allocation and utilization, and changes to PII. Logs must be kept for all administrators and operators performing
    activities in cloud environments.</p>
<p>a. All information systems within the organization must synchronize their clocks by implementing Network Time
    Protocol (NTP) or a similar capability. All information systems must synchronize with the same primary time source.
