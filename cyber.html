<h1 id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h1>
<p>a. The purpose of this policy is to define the procedures to assess and treat information security risks within the
    organization, and to define the acceptable level of risk overall.</p>
<p>a. Risk assessment and risk treatment are applied to the entire scope of the organization’s information security
    program, and to all information systems which are used within the organization or which could have an impact on the
    organization’s information security.</p>
<p>a. This policy applies to all management and employees that take part in the organization’s risk assessments. This
    policy must be made readily available to all whom it applies to.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>a. This policy defines a step-by-step process for conducting risk assessments, as well as to treat identified risks
    from an information security perspective. This policy also describes how to prepare the Risk Assessment Report
    required as part of the risk assessment process.</p>
<p>a. When conducting a risk assessment, the organization must identify all organizational information systems . It must
    then identify all threats and vulnerabilities having to do with such systems , and rate the severity of such threats
    and vulnerabilities according to a predefined rating scale. Asset and risk owners must be defined for each risk
    item.</p>
<p>a. Once the risk assessment is completed, the organization shall determine how to manage risks where the overall
    assessed risk rating is deemed as too high. This management is known as risk treatment. Risk treatment options
    include but are not limited to applying security controls, outsourcing risk, accepting risk, or discontinuing the
    activity associated with the risk.</p>
<p>a. A penetration test must be performed by a third party to verify the accuracy of the risk assessment and
    effectiveness of deployed risk treatments.</p>
<h1 id="procedure-to-execute-risk-assessment-report">Procedure To Execute Risk Assessment Report</h1>
<p>a. Confirms that the entire risk assessment and risk treatment process has been carried out according to the Risk
    Assessment Policy.</p>
<p>a. The purpose of the risk assessment was to identify all information systems their vulnerabilities, and threats that
    could exploit vulnerabilities. These parameters were further evaluated in order to establish the criticality of
    individual risks.</p>
<p>a. The purpose of the risk treatment was to define the systematic means of reducing or controlling the risks
    identified in the risk assessment.</p>
<p>a. All risk assessment and treatment activities were completed within the scope of the organization’s information
    security program.</p>
<p>a. The risk assessment was implemented in the period from [day/month/year] to [day/month/year]. The risk treatment
    was implemented from [day/month/year] to [day/month/year]. Final reports were prepared during [specify period].</p>
<p>a. The risk assessment and risk treatment process was managed by [person responsible for managing the risk assessment
    process] with expert assistance provided by [person or company responsible for assistance].</p>
<p>a. During the risk assessment, information was collected through questionnaires and interviews with responsible
    persons, namely the asset owners across organizational units.</p>
<p>a. The process was conducted as follows:</p>
<pre><code>i. All information systems <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> their owners were identified.
    
    i. Threats were identified <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> asset, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> corresponding vulnerabilities were identified <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> threat.
    i. Risk owners were identified <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> risk.
    
    i. Consequences <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> loss <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> confidentiality, integrity <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> availability were evaluated <span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> score <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> being <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> lowest rating <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span> being <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> highest rating.
    
    i. The likelihood <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> risk occurrence (i.e. that <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> threat will exploit <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> vulnerability) was evaluated <span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> score <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> being <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> lowest rating <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span> being <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> highest rating.
    
    i. The level <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> risk was calculated <span class="hljs-keyword">by</span> adding up <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> consequence <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> likelihood.
    
    i. Risks <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> score <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-number">4</span> were determined <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> be unacceptable risks.
    
    i. For <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> unacceptable risk, <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> risk treatment option was considered, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> appropriate information security controls were selected.
    
    i. After controls were applied, residual risks were assessed.
